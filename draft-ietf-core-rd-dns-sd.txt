Abstract

   Resource and service discovery are complementary.  Resource discovery
   provides fine-grained detail about the content of a web server, while
   service discovery can provide a scalable method to locate servers in
   large networks.  This document defines a method for mapping between
   CoRE Link Format attributes and DNS-Based Service Discovery records
   to facilitate the use of either method to locate RESTful service
   interfaces (APIs) in heterogeneous HTTP/CoAP environments.

1.  Introduction and Background

   The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) working group aims at
   realizing the [REST] architecture in a suitable form for the most
   constrained devices (e.g. 8-bit microcontrollers with limited RAM and
   ROM) and networks (e.g. 6LoWPAN [RFC4944]).  CoRE is aimed at
   machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and
   building automation.  The main deliverable of CoRE is the Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP) specification [RFC7252].

   CoRE Link Format [RFC6690] is intended to support fine-grained
   discovery of hosted resources, their attributes, and possibly other
   related resources.  Automated dynamic discovery of resources hosted

   by a constrained server is critical in M2M applications, where human
   intervention is minimal and static configurations result in
   brittleness.

   DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) [RFC6763] supports wide-area
   search for instances of a given service type (i.e. servers that
   support a particular application protocol stack).  A service instance
   consists of a server's name, IP address, and port number plus
   additional meta-data about the server.  This data may extend to
   support multi-function devices, where multiple services are available
   at the same endpoint.  The result of the discovery process may
   include a path to a resource representing the entry point to each
   function's RESTful service interface and possibly a link to a formal
   description of that interface (e.g. a JSON Hyper-Schema document
   [I-D.handrews-json-schema-hyperschema]).

   Resource and service discovery are complementary in the case of large
   networks, where the latter can facilitate scaling.  This document
   defines a mapping between CoRE Link Format attributes and DNS-Based
   Service Discovery records that permits discovery of CoAP services by
   either method.  It also addresses the CoRE charter goal to
   interoperate with DNS-SD.

   The primary use case for mapping between resource and service
   discovery is to support heterogeneous HTTP/CoAP environments where,
   for example, HTTP clients may discover and communicate with CoAP
   servers that are behind a "cross proxy" [RFC8075].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].  The term "byte" is used in its now conventional sense as
   a synonym for "octet".

   This specification requires readers to be familiar with all the terms
   and concepts that are discussed in [RFC6690] and [RFC8288].  Readers
   should also be familiar with the terms and concepts discussed in
   [RFC7252].

   This specification also incorporates the terminology of
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].

   In particular, the following terms are used frequently:






van der Stok, et al.     Expires January 8, 2020                [Page 3]

   Endpoint: a web server associated with a specific IP address and
   port; thus a physical device may host one or more endpoints.
   Endpoints may also act as clients.

   Link: Web Linking [RFC8288] defines a Web Link (link) as a typed
   connection between two resources, comprised of:

   o  a link context,

   o  a link relation type (see Section 2.1 of [RFC8288],

   o  a link target, and

   o  optionally, target attributes (see Section 2.2 of [RFC8288]).

   A link can be viewed as a statement of the form "link context has a
   link relation type resource at link target, which (optionally) has
   target attributes", where link target and context are typically
   Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs) [RFC3986].  For example,
   "https://www.example.com/" has a "canonical" resource at
   "https://example.com", which has a "type" of "text/html".

1.2.  CoRE Resource Discovery

   The main function of Resource Discovery is to return links to the
   resources hosted by a server, complemented by attributes about those
   resources and additional link relations.  In CoRE this collection of
   links and attributes is itself a resource (in contrast to HTTP, where
   headers delivered with a specific resource describe its attributes).

   Resource Discovery can be performed either unicast or multicast.
   When a server's IP address is already known, either a priori or
   resolved via the Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1034][RFC1035], unicast
   discovery is performed in order to locate the entry point to the
   resource of interest.  This is performed using a GET to "/.well-
   known/core" on the server, which returns a payload in the CoRE Link
   Format [RFC6690].  A client would then match the appropriate Resource
   Type, Interface Description, and possible media type [RFC2045] for
   its application.  These attributes may also be included in the query
   string in order to filter the number of links returned in a response.

   Multicast Resource Discovery is useful when a client needs to locate
   a resource within a limited scope, and that scope supports IP
   multicast.  A GET request to the appropriate multicast address is
   made for "/.well-known/core".  In order to limit the number and size
   of responses, a query string is recommended with the known
   attributes.  Typically, a resource would be discovered based on its




van der Stok, et al.     Expires January 8, 2020                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft   CoRE Resource Directory: DNS-SD mapping       July 2019


   Resource Type and/or Interface Description, along with possible
   application-specific attributes.

1.3.  CoRE Resource Directories

   In many M2M scenarios, direct discovery of resources is not practical
   due to sleeping nodes, limited bandwidth, or networks where multicast
   traffic is inefficient.  These problems can be solved by deploying a
   network element called a Resource Directory (RD), which hosts
   descriptions of resources that originate on other endpoints and
   allows indirect lookups to be performed for those resources.

   The Resource Directory implements a set of REST interfaces for
   endpoints to register and maintain collections of links, called
   Resource Directory registrations.  [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory]
   specifies the web interfaces that an RD supports for endpoints to
   discover the RD and to register, maintain, lookup and remove resource
   descriptions; for the RD to validate entries; and for clients to
   lookup resources from the RD.

1.4.  DNS-Based Service Discovery

   DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) defines a conventional method of
   naming and configuring DNS PTR, SRV, and TXT resource records to
   facilitate discovery of services (such as CoAP servers in a
   subdomain) using the existing DNS infrastructure.  This section gives
   a brief overview of DNS-SD; for a detailed specification see
   [RFC6763].

   DNS-SD Service Names are limited to 255 bytes and are of the form:

         Service Name = <Instance>.<ServiceType>.<Domain>

   The Service Name identifies a SRV/TXT Resource Record (RR) pair.  The
   SRV RR specifies the hostname and port of an endpoint.  The TXT RR
   provides additional information in the form of key/value pairs.  DNS-
   Based Service Discovery is accomplished by sending a DNS request for
   PTR records with the name <ServiceType>.<Domain>, which will return a
   list of zero or more Service Names.

   The <Domain> part of the Service Name is identical to the global (DNS
   subdomain) part of the authority in URIs [RFC3986] that identify the
   resources on an individual server or group of servers.

   The <ServiceType> part is generally composed of two labels.  The
   first label of the pair is the application protocol name [RFC6335]
   preceded by an underscore character.  For example, an organization
   such as the Open Connectivity Foundation [OCF] that specifies



van der Stok, et al.     Expires January 8, 2020                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   CoRE Resource Directory: DNS-SD mapping       July 2019


   Resource Types [RFC6335] might register application protocol names
   beginning with "oic", which all servers that advertise OCF resources
   would use as part of their ServiceType.  The second label indicates
   the transport protocol binding and is typically "_udp" for CoAP
   services.

   The default <Instance> part of the Service Name SHOULD be set to a
   default value at the factory and MAY be modified during the
   commissioning process.  It MUST uniquely identify an instance of
   <ServiceType> within a <Domain>.  Taken together, these three
   elements comprise a unique name for an SRV/TXT record pair within the
   DNS subdomain.

   The granularity of a Service Name MAY be that of a host or group, or
   it might represent a particular resource within a CoAP server.  The
   SRV record contains the host name (AAAA record name) and port of the
   endpoint, while protocol is part of the Service Name.  In the case
   where a Service Name identifies a particular resource, the path part
   of the URI must be carried in a corresponding TXT record.

   A DNS TXT record is in practice limited to a few hundred bytes in
   length, which is indicated in the resource record header in the DNS
   response message (See section 6 of [RFC6763]).  The data consist of
   one or more strings comprising a key/value pair.  By convention, the
   first pair is txtver=<number> (to support different versions of a
   service description).  Each string is formatted as a single length
   byte followed by 0-255 bytes of text.  An example string is:

                 ----------------------------------------
                 | 0x08 | t | x | t | v | e | r | = | 1 |
                 ----------------------------------------

2.  New Link-Format Attributes

   When using the CoRE Link Format to describe resources being
   discovered by or posted to a resource directory service, additional
   information about those resources is often useful.  This
   specification defines the following new attributes for use in the
   CoRE Link Format [RFC6690] to enable the data-driven mappings
   described in Section 3:

      link-extension    = ( "exp" )
      link-extension    = ( "ins" "=" (ptoken | quoted-string) )
                          ; The token or string is max 63 bytes
      link-extension    = ( "st" "=" (ptoken | quoted-string) )
                          ; The token or string is max 15 bytes

Internet-Draft   CoRE Resource Directory: DNS-SD mapping       July 2019


2.1.  Export attribute "exp"

   The Export "exp" attribute is used as a flag to indicate that a link
   description MAY be exported from a resource directory to external
   directories.

   The CoRE Link Format is used for many purposes between CoAP
   endpoints.  Some are useful mainly locally; for example checking the
   observability of a resource before accessing it, determining the size
   of a resource, or traversing dynamic resource structures.  However,
   other links are very useful to be exported to other directories, for
   example the entry point resource to a functional service.  This
   attribute MAY be used as a query parameter in the RD Lookup Function
   Set defined in Section 6 of [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].

2.2.  Resource Instance attribute "ins="

   The Resource Instance "ins=" attribute is an identifier for this
   resource, which makes it possible to distinguish it from other
   similar resources in a Resource Directory.  This attribute specifies
   the value to be used for the <Instance> portion of an exported DNS-SD
   Service Name (see Section 1.4), and SHOULD be unique across resources
   with the same Resource Type "rt=" attribute in the domain in which it
   is used.

   A Resource Instance SHOULD be a descriptive human readable string
   like "Ceiling Light, Room 3".  This attribute MUST NOT be more than
   63 bytes in length.  The resource identifier attribute MUST NOT
   appear more than once in a link description.  This attribute MAY be
   used as a query parameter in the RD Lookup Function Set defined in
   Section 7 of [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].

2.3.  Service Type attribute "st="

   The Service Type instance "st=" attribute specifies the value to be
   used for the <ServiceType> portion of an exported DNS-SD Service Name
   (see Section 1.4).  This attribute MUST NOT be more than 15 bytes in
   length (see [RFC6335], Section 5.1) and MUST be present in the IANA
   Service Name registry [st].

3.  Mapping CoRE Link Attributes to DNS-SD Record Fields

3.1.  Mapping Resource Instance attribute "ins=" to <Instance>

   The Resource Instance "ins=" attribute maps directly to the
   <Instance> part of a DNS-SD Service Name.  It is stored directly in
   the DNS as a single DNS label of canonical precomposed UTF-8
   [RFC3629] "Net-Unicode" (Unicode Normalization Form C) [RFC5198]



van der Stok, et al.     Expires January 8, 2020                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft   CoRE Resource Directory: DNS-SD mapping       July 2019


   text.  However, if the "ins=" attribute is chosen to match the DNS
   host name of a service, it SHOULD use the syntax defined in
   Section 3.5 of [RFC1034] and Section 2.1 of [RFC1123].

   The <Instance> part of the name of a service being offered on the
   network SHOULD be configurable by the user setting up the service, so
   that he or she may give it an informative name.  However, the device
   or service SHOULD NOT require the user to configure a name before it
   can be used.  A sensible choice of default name can allow the device
   or service to be accessed in many cases without any manual
   configuration at all (see Appendix D of [RFC6763]).

   DNS labels are limited to 63 bytes in length and the entire Service
   Name may not exceed 255 bytes.

3.2.  Mapping Service Type attribute "st=" to <ServiceType>

   The Service Type "st=" attribute maps directly to the <ServiceType>
   part of a DNS-SD Service Name.

   In practice, the ServiceType should unambiguously identify
   interoperable devices.  It is up to individual SDOs to specify how to
   represent their registered Resource Type "rt=" values as registered
   application protocol names according to [RFC6335].  The application
   name is then used as the value of the resource "st=" attribute.

   The resulting application protocol name MUST be composed of at least
   a single Net-Unicode text string, without underscore '_' or period
   '.' and limited to 15 bytes in length (see Section 5.1 of [RFC6335]).
   This string is mapped to the DNS-SD <ServiceType> by prepending an
   underscore and appending a period followed by the "_udp" label.  For
   example, rt="oic.d.light" might correspond to the registered
   application protocol name st="oic-d-light" and would be mapped into
   Service Type "_oic-d-light._udp".

   The resulting string is used to form labels for DNS-SD records which
   are stored directly in the DNS.

3.3.  <Domain> Mapping

   TBD: A method must be specified to determine which DNS zone the CoAP
   service description should be exported to.  See, for example,
   Section 11 in [RFC6763] and Section 2 in
   [I-D.sctl-service-registration].

Internet-Draft   CoRE Resource Directory: DNS-SD mapping       July 2019


3.4.  TXT Record key=value strings

   DNS-SD key/value pairs may be derived from CoRE Link Format
   information and exported as key=value strings in a DNS-SD TXT record
   (See Section 6.3 of [RFC6763]).

   The resource <URI> is exported as key/value pair "path=<URI>".

   The Interface Description "if=" attribute is exported as key/value
   pair "if=<Interface Description>".

   The DNS TXT record can be further populated by importing any other
   resource description attributes as they share the same key=value
   format specified in Section 6 of [RFC6763].

3.5.  Exporting resource links into DNS-SD

   Assuming the ability to query a Resource Directory or multicast a GET
   (?exp) over the local link, CoAP resource discovery may be used to
   populate the DNS-SD database in an automated fashion.  CoAP resource
   descriptions (links) can be exported to DNS-SD for exposure to
   service discovery by using the Resource Instance attribute as the
   basis for a unique Service Name, composed with the Service Type
   attribute as the <ServiceType>, and registered in the appropriate
   <Domain>.  The agent responsible for exporting records to the DNS
   zone file SHOULD be authenticated to the DNS server.  The following
   example, using the example lookup location /rd-lookup, shows an agent
   discovering a resource to be exported:

    Req: GET /rd-lookup/res?exp

    Res: 2.05 Content
    <coap://[FDFD::1234]:5683/light/1>;
      exp;st=oic-d-light;rt="oic.d.light";ins="Spot";
                d="sector";ep="node1"

   The agent subsequently registers the following DNS-SD RRs, assuming a
   derived DNS zone name "office.example.com":

   _oic-d-light._udp.office.example.com      IN PTR
            Spot._oic-d-light._udp.office.example.com
   Spot._oic-d-light._udp.office.example.com IN TXT
            txtver=1;path=/light/1;rt=oic.d.light;d=sector
   Spot._oic-d-light._udp.office.example.com IN SRV
            0 0 5683 node1.office.example.com.
   node1.office.example.com.                 IN AAAA FDFD::1234

4.  Exporting Resource Directory Service to DNS

   In some cases it is required that one (or more) Resource Directories
   (RD) in a given DNS domain can be discoverable from DNS.  The /.well-
   known/core resource of the RD should reflect this by specifying the
   "ins", "exp", and the "st" attributes in the the link of the RD
   service.  This document specifies in Section 5 two servicetypes: _rd-
   lookup-res._udp and _rd-lookup-ep._udp for resource types rt =
   core.rd-lookup-res and rt = core.rd-lookup-ep respectively.  The
   default coap and coaps ports are respectively: 5683 and 5684.

   The value of the instance MAY be specified by the manager of the
   resource directories.  In case of an unmanaged RD (for example in a
   home network) it is recommended that the ins parameter takes a value
   provided by an Authorization Server during the acceptance of the RD
   to the network (see for example section 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory]).

   With the assumption that the "ins" value is attributed by
   Authorization Server, and [FDFD::1234] is IP address of RD, Example
   links for RD are:

        Req: GET coap://[FDFD::1234]/.well-known/core?exp

        Res: 2.05 Content
        <rd-lookup/res>;
          exp;st=rd-lookup-res;rt="core.rd-lookup-res";
          ins="505567",
        <rd-lookup/ep>;
          exp;st=rd-lookup-ep;rt="core.rd-lookup-ep";
          ins="505572"

   The link atributes can be exported to RR by the mapping process
   described in Section 3.

5.  IANA considerations

   Two registries are affected by this document: (1) "RD Parameters"
   registry under "Core Parameters" registry, and (2) Service Name and
   Transport Protocol Port Number Registry

5.1.  RD Parameters Registry

   This specification defines new parameters for the registry "RD
   Parameters" provided under "CoRE Parameters" (TBD).

5.2.  Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry

   This specification defines new parameters for the Service Name and
   Transport Protocol Port Number Registry:

   * _rd-lookup-res._udp at ports 5683 and 5684
   * _rd-lookup-ep._udp at ports 5683 and 5684

6.  Security considerations

   Malicious nodes can export fake link attributes to DNS.  It is
   recommended that the RD can be authenticated, and is authorized to
   both join the network and export its link attributes.  Authentication
   is specified in [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

7.  Contributors

   Keryy lynn was the initiator of, and major contributor to this
   document.  This document was split out from
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].  Zach Shelby was a co-author of
   the original version of this draft.

8.  Acknowledgments

   The authors wish to thank Stuart Cheshire, Ted Lemon, and David
   Thaler for their thorough reviews and clarifying suggestions.
